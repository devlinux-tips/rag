# RAG Prototypes

## Overview
Rapid prototyping space for multilingual RAG system UI/UX validation before React implementation.

## Current Prototypes

### 01-multilingual-ui
**Goal**: Validate multilingual interface design with dual language selection model

#### v1-basic (HTML + Vanilla JS + Dark Theme)
**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
**Features**:
- Interface language switching (Croatian/English)
- Search language selection (hr/en/multilingual)
- Dark theme design
- Mock search results with language indicators
- Responsive mobile design

**Live Demo**: Open `01-multilingual-ui/v1-basic/index.html` in browser

#### Validation Goals
- [ ] Language switching intuitive and clear
- [ ] Search experience feels natural across languages
- [ ] Language indicators helpful for mixed results
- [ ] Mobile experience works well
- [ ] Dark theme enhances usability

## Next Iterations
- v2-enhanced: File upload with language detection
- v3-interactive: Mock API integration with realistic delays
- v4-streamlit: Python integration with actual RAG system

## Lessons Learned

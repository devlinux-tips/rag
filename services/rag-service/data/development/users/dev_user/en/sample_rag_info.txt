What is a RAG System?

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is an advanced AI architecture that combines two powerful techniques: information retrieval and language generation. This hybrid approach allows AI systems to access and utilize external knowledge sources when generating responses, making them more accurate and informative.

How RAG Works

The RAG process involves several key steps:
1. Document Processing: Raw documents are processed and converted into searchable chunks
2. Vector Embeddings: Text chunks are converted into numerical representations using embedding models
3. Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search
4. Query Processing: User questions are processed and converted into embeddings
5. Retrieval: The system searches for the most relevant document chunks
6. Generation: A language model generates responses using the retrieved context

Key Components

Document Extractor: Processes various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and extracts clean text
Text Cleaner: Normalizes and cleans extracted text for better processing
Document Chunker: Splits large documents into manageable pieces
Embedding Model: Converts text into numerical vectors (e.g., BGE-M3 for multilingual support)
Vector Database: Stores and indexes embeddings for fast similarity search (e.g., ChromaDB)
Search Engine: Finds the most relevant chunks for a given query
Language Model: Generates natural language responses (e.g., using Ollama with qwen2.5)

Benefits of RAG

RAG systems offer several advantages over traditional language models:
- Access to up-to-date information from external sources
- Reduced hallucination by grounding responses in actual documents
- Ability to work with domain-specific knowledge
- Transparency through source attribution
- Cost-effective compared to training massive models

Use Cases

RAG systems are particularly useful for:
- Question answering over company documents
- Customer support with knowledge base integration
- Research assistance with academic papers
- Legal document analysis
- Technical documentation queries

This makes RAG an excellent choice for applications requiring accurate, source-backed responses from large document collections.

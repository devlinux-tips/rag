### **Advanced Demonstrations**

#### `hybrid_retrieval_demo.ipynb` ⚡
**Enhanced Retrieval for Croatian Text**

Demonstrates the improved retrieval system with:
- **Croatian BM25**: Handles inflected words and exact matches
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines embeddings (70%) + BM25 (30%)
- **Multilingual Reranker**: BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3 for final precision
- **Performance Analysis**: Cost, speed, and quality comparisons

**Best for**: Understanding why hybrid retrieval works better for Croatian legal documents with specific terms (EUR amounts, dates).

## 🚀 Recent System Achievements

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Model**: qwen2.5:7b-instruct (Q4_K_M quantized, 4.7GB)
- **Speed**: 32% faster generation (83.5s vs 123s baseline)
- **Quality**: Excellent Croatian with proper diacritics
- **Reliability**: Consistent instruction following in RAG contexts

### **Architecture Improvements**
- **RAGSystem**: Renamed from CroatianRAGSystem for multilingual design
- **Configuration**: Optimized parameters (max_tokens=800, top_k=40)
- **Context**: Reduced context length to 2500 for faster processing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides in `docs/` folder

**Run with**:
```bash
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook hybrid_retrieval_demo.ipynb
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements Explained

### Why Croatian Needs Special Handling

Croatian is **highly inflected** - words change endings:
- "odluka" → "odluke", "odluku", "odlukama" (decision)
- "iznos" → "iznosi", "iznosa", "iznosima" (amount)

**Pure embeddings** miss exact matches for:
- Currency: "EUR", "15,32", "331,23"
- Dates: "1. srpnja 2025" (July 1, 2025)
- Legal terms: specific Croatian vocabulary

### 3-Stage Retrieval Pipeline

1. **Dense Search** (Embeddings)
   - Gets 20 semantically similar candidates
   - Handles synonyms and conceptual matches

2. **Hybrid Filtering** (Dense + BM25)
   - Combines semantic + lexical signals
   - Reduces to 10 best candidates
   - Weights: 70% dense, 30% BM25

3. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**
   - Sees full query + document context
   - Final precision scoring
   - Returns top 5 most relevant

### Performance Gains

For the query: *"Koje odluke su donesene 1. srpnja 2025, zanimaju nas samo iznosi u EURima?"*

| Method | Precision | Recall | Speed |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Dense Only | 60% | 70% | Fast |
| + BM25 | 80% | 85% | Fast |
| + Reranker | 90% | 85% | Medium |

## 🛠️ Setup Requirements

```bash
# Install additional dependencies
pip install rank-bm25 transformers torch

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

## 💡 Usage Tips

1. **Try different queries** in the notebooks to see how each method performs
2. **Adjust hybrid weights** based on your document type:
   - Legal documents: More BM25 (exact terms matter)
   - Conceptual docs: More embeddings (semantic similarity)
3. **Monitor model downloads** - reranker is ~2GB on first use
4. **Use CPU mode** - all components work efficiently without GPU

## 🔧 Integration

The notebooks demonstrate techniques used in the main RAG system (`rag.py`).

To use in production:
```python
# Enhanced RAG with hybrid retrieval
rag = CroatianRAG()
await rag.process_documents()  # Indexes for hybrid search
await rag.query("Your Croatian question")  # Uses 3-stage pipeline
```

## 📊 Cost Analysis

| Component | Memory | Speed | Cost |
|-----------|---------|-------|------|
| BM25 | 1MB | <1ms | Free |
| Embeddings | 500MB | 50ms | Free |
| Reranker | 1.5GB | 300ms | Free |
| **Total** | **~2GB** | **~350ms** | **$0** |

**One-time setup**: ~5 minutes to download models
**Runtime**: CPU-friendly, no GPU required
**Quality**: Significantly better for Croatian factual queries

The improvements target your specific use case: finding exact EUR amounts and dates in Croatian legal documents.

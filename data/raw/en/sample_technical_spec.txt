Technical Specification Document
Project: Advanced AI System Integration
Date: September 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document outlines the technical requirements and specifications for implementing an advanced AI system integration project. The system will provide multilingual natural language processing capabilities with a focus on Croatian and English language support.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Hardware Requirements:
   - Minimum 16GB RAM
   - NVIDIA GPU with 8GB VRAM (recommended: RTX 4070 or better)
   - 500GB SSD storage
   - Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 processor

2. Software Requirements:
   - Python 3.9 or higher
   - CUDA 11.8+ for GPU acceleration
   - Docker for containerization
   - PostgreSQL 14+ for data storage

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:
- Document Processing Engine: Handles PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
- Vector Database: ChromaDB for semantic search
- Embedding Model: BGE-M3 for multilingual embeddings
- Language Model: Qwen2.5 7B for text generation

PERFORMANCE METRICS
Expected performance benchmarks:
- Document processing: 100 pages/minute
- Query response time: < 2 seconds
- Accuracy: > 85% for relevant document retrieval
- Multilingual support: Croatian, English, and mixed-language documents

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- All data processing happens locally (no cloud dependencies)
- Encrypted storage for sensitive documents
- Access control and audit logging
- GDPR compliance for European data protection

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
Phase 1 (Month 1): Core system setup and document processing
Phase 2 (Month 2): Vector database implementation and semantic search
Phase 3 (Month 3): Language model integration and query processing
Phase 4 (Month 4): Testing, optimization, and deployment

COST ANALYSIS
Development costs: €25,000
Hardware costs: €5,000
Maintenance (annual): €3,000
Total first-year cost: €33,000

RISK ASSESSMENT
Low risk: Hardware compatibility issues
Medium risk: Performance optimization challenges
High risk: Multilingual accuracy requirements

This specification serves as the foundation for the AI system development project.

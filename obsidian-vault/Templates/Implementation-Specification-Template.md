# Implementation Specification: [Feature Name]

**Created**: {{date}}
**Phase**: Phase X
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Complexity**: Low/Medium/High/Critical

## 📖 Overview

Clear description of what this specification covers and why it needs detailed planning.

**Context**:
- Where this fits in the overall system
- What problem it solves
- Integration points with other services

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Scenarios
- [ ] **Scenario 1**: Description of expected normal operation
  - Input: Specific example data
  - Expected Output: Specific expected results
  - Success Criteria: How to verify success

- [ ] **Scenario 2**: Another normal operation case
  - Input: Different example data
  - Expected Output: Expected results
  - Success Criteria: Verification method

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- [ ] **Network Timeout**: How system behaves when external service is slow
  - Expected Behavior: Graceful degradation or retry logic
  - User Experience: What user sees during timeout
  - Recovery: How system recovers

- [ ] **Invalid Input**: Handling of malformed or invalid data
  - Input Examples: Specific invalid data cases
  - Expected Response: Error messages and codes
  - Logging: What gets logged for debugging

- [ ] **Resource Exhaustion**: System behavior under high load
  - Trigger Conditions: What causes resource exhaustion
  - Expected Behavior: Rate limiting, queuing, or rejection
  - Recovery: How system returns to normal operation

## ⚡ Performance Expectations

**Response Time Requirements**:
- API endpoints: < Xms for 95th percentile
- File processing: Progress updates every Xms
- Database queries: < Xms average

**Throughput Requirements**:
- Concurrent requests: Handle X simultaneous operations
- Batch processing: Process X items per minute
- Memory usage: Stay under XMB during normal operation

**Scalability Targets**:
- Horizontal scaling: Support X instances
- Load distribution: Even load across instances
- Resource growth: Linear scaling with load

## 🇭🇷 Croatian Language Specifics

**Diacritics Handling**:
- [ ] Preserve Č, Ć, Š, Ž, Đ in all transformations
- [ ] Handle mixed Croatian-English text correctly
- [ ] Maintain proper encoding (UTF-8) throughout pipeline

**Morphological Considerations**:
- [ ] Account for Croatian inflection patterns
- [ ] Handle plural forms correctly (knjiga/knjige/knjiga)
- [ ] Process diminutive forms appropriately

**Cultural Context**:
- [ ] Recognize Croatian cultural references
- [ ] Handle Croatian address formats
- [ ] Process Croatian date/time formats (DD.MM.YYYY)

**Search Behavior**:
- [ ] Semantic search works with Croatian synonyms
- [ ] Regional variations handled (ijekavski/ekavski)
- [ ] Historical Croatian text processing

## 🔌 Integration Points

**Service Communication**:
- **From**: Which services call this functionality
- **To**: Which external services this calls
- **Data Format**: JSON schema or data structure examples
- **Authentication**: Required auth tokens or API keys
- **Error Propagation**: How errors bubble up the chain

**Example API Contracts**:
```json
// Request Format
{
  "query": "Što je RAG sustav?",
  "language": "hr",
  "max_results": 5,
  "tenant_id": "abc123"
}

// Response Format
{
  "results": [...],
  "processing_time_ms": 150,
  "language_detected": "hr",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

// Error Response
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests",
  "retry_after_seconds": 30
}
```

## 🏗️ Implementation Notes

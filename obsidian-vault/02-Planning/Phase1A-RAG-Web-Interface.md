# Phase 1A: RAG Web Interface (User GUI First)

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Status**: ðŸ”² Planning
**Progress**: 0% (0/4 milestones)
**Started**: TBD
**Target Completion**: TBD

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objectives

**User GUI First Strategy** - Prove value before complexity:
- Create direct web interface for existing Python RAG system
- Enable immediate validation of multilingual processing (Croatian, English, mixed)
- Provide user-friendly interface with language selection and i18n support
- Focus on multilingual user experience and RAG quality validation
- **Keep existing RAG system completely unchanged**

## ðŸ“‹ Milestones & Progress

### Milestone 1: FastAPI Backend Wrapper
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started
**Estimated**: 0.5 weeks
**Dependencies**: None

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create FastAPI application (`services/web-api/`)
- [ ] Implement HTTP endpoints wrapping existing RAG system with language parameter support
- [ ] Add CORS support for React frontend

- [ ] Language-aware search endpoint (`/search?lang=hr|en|multilingual`)

**Deliverables**:
- Working FastAPI service that exposes multilingual RAG functionality via HTTP
- Document upload endpoint with language parameter and basic progress tracking
- Search endpoint with language selection returning language-appropriate results
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Language detection and routing capabilities

### Milestone 2: React User Interface
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started
**Estimated**: 1 week
**Dependencies**: Milestone 1

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Initialize React + Vite + TypeScript project (`services/user-frontend/`)
- [ ] Add internationalization (i18n) with react-i18next for multilingual interface
- [ ] Create language selection component (Croatian, English interface languages)
- [ ] Create search interface with input language selection (hr/en/multilingual)
- [ ] Implement document upload with drag-and-drop and language specification
- [ ] Add results display with relevance scores, source attribution, and language indicators
- [ ] Create basic error handling and loading states in selected interface language
- [ ] Add responsive design for desktop and mobile testing

**Deliverables**:
- Multilingual search interface with language selection for input and interface
- Document upload with language specification and progress indication
- Results display with proper multilingual text rendering and language indicators
- i18n-enabled interface supporting Croatian and English
- Responsive design working on desktop and mobile
- Error handling with localized user-friendly messages

### Milestone 3: Multilingual Validation
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started
**Estimated**: 0.5 weeks
**Dependencies**: Milestone 2

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Upload test documents in Croatian, English, and mixed languages
- [ ] Test search queries in Croatian with various morphological forms
- [ ] Test search queries in English with technical terminology
- [ ] Validate mixed-language document processing and code-switching
- [ ] Test cultural context understanding in both languages
- [ ] Document language quality benchmarks for both Croatian and English
- [ ] Create language-specific test cases and cross-language validation

**Deliverables**:
- Validated multilingual processing quality (Croatian, English, mixed)
- Test suite covering morphology, diacritics, and language-switching
- Benchmarks for search relevance in both languages
- Documentation of multilingual capabilities and language detection
- User acceptance criteria for all language features

---

### Milestone 4: Integration & User Testing
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started
**Estimated**: 0.5 weeks
**Dependencies**: All previous milestones

**Tasks**:
- [ ] End-to-end testing of upload â†’ processing â†’ search workflow across all languages
- [ ] Performance testing with various document sizes, types, and languages
- [ ] User experience testing with Croatian, English, and mixed content
- [ ] Interface language switching and i18n functionality testing
- [ ] Documentation updates for new multilingual web interface
- [ ] Create multilingual user guide with examples in both languages
- [ ] Prepare for stakeholder demonstrations with multilingual scenarios

**Deliverables**:
- Working end-to-end multilingual RAG web interface with language selection
- Performance benchmarks for multilingual user experience
- Comprehensive user guide with Croatian and English examples
- i18n-enabled interface tested in both languages
- Ready for user feedback and multilingual stakeholder demos
- Foundation for Phase 1B enhancements

## ðŸš§ Risks & Mitigation

**Risk: FastAPI Integration Complexity**
- *Impact*: Medium (could delay web interface)
- *Probability*: Low (FastAPI integration is straightforward)
- *Mitigation*: Start with simple HTTP wrapper, existing RAG system unchanged

**Risk: Multilingual Quality Issues**
- *Impact*: High (core value proposition)
- *Probability*: Low (existing RAG system already handles multiple languages well)
- *Mitigation*: Extensive testing with Croatian, English, and mixed-language content types

**Risk: User Experience Expectations**
- *Impact*: Medium (affects user adoption)
- *Probability*: Medium (first web interface iteration)
- *Mitigation*: Focus on functionality first, iterate based on user feedback

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

- [ ] Can upload documents in any supported language and see them processed successfully
- [ ] Can select input language (Croatian, English, multilingual) and get accurate results
- [ ] Can switch interface language between Croatian and English seamlessly
- [ ] Multilingual text (diacritics, special characters) preserved throughout entire pipeline
- [ ] Search relevance scores meaningful across all supported languages
- [ ] Language detection and routing works correctly for mixed-language content
- [ ] Web interface responsive and user-friendly on desktop and mobile in both languages
- [ ] Ready for stakeholder demonstrations with multilingual scenarios
- [ ] Foundation established for adding job orchestration in Phase 1B

## ðŸ”— Dependencies

**This Phase Depends On**:
- Existing Python RAG system (âœ… already working)
- Basic development environment (Python, Node.js)
- Croatian test documents for validation

**This Phase Blocks**:
- Phase 1B: Basic Orchestration
- Phase 2: Advanced Platform Features
- All stakeholder demos and user feedback sessions

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

**Week 1**:
- [ ] Milestone 1: FastAPI Backend Wrapper
- [ ] Start Milestone 2: React User Interface
- Current blockers: None identified
- Next week priorities: Complete UI implementation

**Week 2**:
- [ ] Complete Milestone 2: React User Interface
- [ ] Milestone 3: Croatian Language Validation
- Current blockers: TBD
- Next week priorities: Integration and testing

**Week 3**:
- [ ] Milestone 4: Integration & User Testing
- Current blockers: TBD
- Next week priorities: Phase 1B planning

## ðŸ”„ Next Phase Preview

**Phase 1B: Basic Orchestration (2-3 weeks)** will focus on:
- Adding simple job queue for document processing
- Implementing progress tracking for uploads
- Adding basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Keeping the same user interface while adding backend robustness
- Preparing for transition to full Phoenix platform-api in Phase 2

This progressive enhancement approach maintains the working user interface while adding the orchestration layer underneath.

- Comprehensive integration test suite
- Performance benchmarks with rate limiting
- Updated documentation reflecting new architecture
- Development environment setup automation
- Ready for Phase 2 distributed features

## ðŸš§ Risks & Mitigation

**Risk: Python-Elixir Integration Complexity**
- *Impact*: High (could block entire phase)
- *Probability*: Medium (HTTP integration is well-understood)
- *Mitigation*: Start with simple HTTP communication, add complexity gradually, create integration tests early

**Risk: Job Queue Performance Under Load**
- *Impact*: Medium (could affect user experience)
- *Probability*: Medium (Oban is battle-tested but our use case is complex)
- *Mitigation*: Start with conservative job limits, monitor queue performance, implement backpressure

**Risk: UI Development Time Expansion**
- *Impact*: Low (UI is for testing, not production-ready)
- *Probability*: High (UI development often takes longer than expected)
- *Mitigation*: Focus on functionality over polish, iterate based on testing feedback

**Risk: Croatian Language Feature Complexity**
- *Impact*: Medium (core differentiator for the platform)
- *Probability*: Low (existing RAG system handles this well)
- *Mitigation*: Preserve existing RAG system unchanged, add Croatian-specific tests

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

- [ ] Can upload Croatian documents and see job progress in real-time
- [ ] Can search documents in Croatian and English getting accurate results
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents system overload during stress testing
- [ ] Feature flags enable/disable functionality without restart
- [ ] All services integrate smoothly with existing RAG system unchanged
- [ ] Performance meets targets: API < 200ms, job progress < 100ms updates
- [ ] Croatian diacritics preserved throughout the entire pipeline
- [ ] System handles concurrent requests (target: 10 simultaneous)

## ðŸ”— Dependencies

**This Phase Depends On**:
- Existing Python RAG system (âœ… already working)
- PostgreSQL installation and setup
- Ollama service running locally for LLM generation
- Basic development environment (Elixir, Node.js, Python)

**This Phase Blocks**:
- Phase 2: Distributed & Advanced Jobs
- Phase 3: Multi-Tenancy & Scale
- All future platform features and enhancements

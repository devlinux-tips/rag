# Phase 1B: Basic Orchestration

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Status**: ðŸ”² Planning
**Progress**: 0% (0/3 milestones)
**Started**: After Phase 1A completion
**Target Completion**: TBD

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase Objectives

**Progressive Enhancement Strategy** - Add orchestration to proven interface:
- Add simple job queue for document processing
- Keep existing user interface working unchanged
- Implement progress tracking for file uploads
- Add basic rate limiting to prevent system abuse
- Prepare foundation for full Phoenix platform-api

## ðŸ“‹ Milestones & Progress

### Milestone 1: Simple Job Queue Implementation
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started
**Estimated**: 1 week
**Dependencies**: Phase 1A completion

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add basic job queue to FastAPI (using Celery or similar)
- [ ] Convert document processing to background jobs
- [ ] Implement job status tracking and progress updates
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time job progress
- [ ] Update React UI to show live progress for uploads
- [ ] Handle job failures with user-friendly error messages

**Deliverables**:
- Document processing happens in background jobs
- Real-time progress updates visible in UI
- Job failure handling with recovery options
- Same user experience with better backend reliability

### Milestone 2: Progress Tracking & Status Updates
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started
**Estimated**: 1 week
**Dependencies**: Milestone 1

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- [ ] Add progress indicators for document embedding generation
- [ ] Create job history and status dashboard
- [ ] Add email/notification system for job completion
- [ ] Implement job cancellation functionality
- [ ] Add detailed error reporting and logging

**Deliverables**:
- Real-time job progress visible to users
- Job history and status tracking
- Email notifications for completed processing
- Job cancellation and error recovery options

### Milestone 3: Basic Rate Limiting & System Protection
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started
**Estimated**: 0.5-1 weeks
**Dependencies**: Milestone 2

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement basic rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Add upload size limits and file type validation
- [ ] Create simple monitoring for system health
- [ ] Add basic authentication/user identification
- [ ] Implement request logging and basic analytics
- [ ] Add system health check dashboard

**Deliverables**:
- Rate limiting prevents system overload
- File upload validation and security
- Basic monitoring and system health checks
- Request logging for usage analysis
- Foundation for user management

## ðŸš§ Risks & Mitigation

**Risk: Job Queue Complexity**
- *Impact*: Medium (could complicate simple system)
- *Probability*: Low (using proven job queue solutions)
- *Mitigation*: Start with simple job queue, add complexity gradually

**Risk: WebSocket Implementation Challenges**
- *Impact*: Medium (affects real-time updates)
- *Probability*: Medium (WebSocket integration can be tricky)
- *Mitigation*: Use established WebSocket libraries, fallback to polling

**Risk: User Interface Disruption**
- *Impact*: High (could break working system)
- *Probability*: Low (additive changes only)
- *Mitigation*: Keep existing UI working, add features incrementally

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

- [ ] Document processing happens reliably in background
- [ ] Users see real-time progress for uploads and processing
- [ ] System handles multiple concurrent users without issues
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse while allowing normal usage
- [ ] All Phase 1A functionality continues working unchanged
- [ ] Foundation ready for Phoenix platform-api migration
- [ ] User experience improved with background processing

## ðŸ”— Dependencies

**This Phase Depends On**:
- Phase 1A: RAG Web Interface (âœ… must be completed first)
- Existing Python RAG system (unchanged)
- Basic job queue solution (Celery/Redis or similar)

**This Phase Blocks**:
- Phase 2: Full Phoenix Platform API
- Advanced job orchestration and distributed features
- Multi-user and multi-tenant capabilities

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

**Week 1**:
- [ ] Milestone 1: Simple Job Queue Implementation
- Current blockers: None (Phase 1A must complete first)
- Next week priorities: Progress tracking implementation

**Week 2**:
- [ ] Milestone 2: Progress Tracking & Status Updates
- Current blockers: TBD
- Next week priorities: Rate limiting and system protection

**Week 3**:
- [ ] Milestone 3: Basic Rate Limiting & System Protection
- Current blockers: TBD
- Next week priorities: Phase 2 planning and Phoenix migration

## ðŸ”„ Next Phase Preview

**Phase 2: Full Platform API (4-6 weeks)** will focus on:
- Migrating from FastAPI to Phoenix platform-api
- Adding advanced job orchestration with Oban
- Implementing distributed rate limiting and feature flags
- Adding Phoenix LiveView admin dashboard
- Maintaining same React user interface throughout migration
- Advanced job workflows and system monitoring

This migration approach ensures the user interface continues working while we build the production-grade platform underneath.

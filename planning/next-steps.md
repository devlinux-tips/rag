# Next Development Priorities

## Phase 1 Implementation Ready ✅

**All planning complete** - Ready to begin development of Python RAG Evolution + Web UI

## Week 1: RAG System Evolution

### 1. **Implement Document Categorization System** ⭐
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 3-4 days
- **Scope**: Add hierarchical router pattern for query classification
- **Deliverables**:
  - Query classification logic (technical, cultural, tourism, etc.)
  - Specialized retrieval contexts for different content types
  - Enhanced prompt template system with 8+ categories

### 2. **Enhanced Prompt Templates Integration**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 2-3 days
- **Scope**: Implement research findings on prompt categorization
- **Deliverables**:
  - Cultural context, tourism, factual, explanatory prompt templates
  - Dynamic prompt selection based on query analysis
  - Template system ready for user customization

## Week 2: SurrealDB Integration

### 3. **SurrealDB Setup and User Management**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 3 days
- **Scope**: Add modern database layer for users and metadata
- **Deliverables**:
  - SurrealDB Python client integration
  - User authentication and profile management
  - Basic user session handling

### 4. **Metadata and Template Storage**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 2-3 days
- **Scope**: Document metadata and user prompt preferences
- **Deliverables**:
  - Document metadata schema (categories, ownership, processing status)
  - User prompt template customization storage
  - Job tracking basics for upload progress

## Week 3: Web Interface Foundation

### 5. **FastAPI Backend Development**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 3-4 days
- **Scope**: REST API for RAG system interaction
- **Deliverables**:
  - Document upload endpoints with progress tracking
  - Search API with category and language selection
  - User authentication and settings endpoints

### 6. **React Frontend Basics**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 3-4 days
- **Scope**: Core user interface components
- **Deliverables**:
  - Search interface with query input and filters
  - Document upload with drag-and-drop
  - Basic results display and user settings

## Week 4: Full Integration

### 7. **End-to-End Functionality**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 4-5 days
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows working
- **Deliverables**:
  - Upload → Process → Search → Results workflow
  - Real-time progress indicators
  - Error handling and user feedback

### 8. **Multilingual Validation (Croatian + English)**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 2-3 days
- **Scope**: Ensure both Croatian and English work equally well (true multilingual)
- **Deliverables**:
  - Croatian: Diacritics, morphology, cultural context testing
  - English: Technical terms, complex queries, context handling
  - Mixed-language content processing verification
  - Equal quality validation for both languages

## Week 5: Polish and Performance

### 9. **Performance Optimization**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 2-3 days
- **Scope**: Ensure acceptable response times
- **Deliverables**:
  - Query response time optimization
  - Upload processing efficiency
  - UI responsiveness improvements

### 10. **Documentation and Deployment**
- **Owner**: AI to implement
- **Estimate**: 2 days
- **Scope**: Setup guides and usage documentation
- **Deliverables**:
  - Development environment setup guide
  - User interface documentation
  - API documentation for future Elixir integration

## Implementation Philosophy

### **UI-First Development**
- Start each milestone with user workflow design
- Implement backend features to support UI interactions
- Test user experience at each integration point

### **Research Integration**
- Implement categorization and prompt enhancements from research
- Build SurrealDB foundation for future multi-tenancy
- Keep vector storage proven (ChromaDB) while modernizing metadata

### **Future-Ready Architecture**
- Clean API boundaries for future Elixir orchestration
- User management foundation for enterprise scaling
- Performance patterns that work with job queue systems

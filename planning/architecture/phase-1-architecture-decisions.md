# Phase 1 Architecture Decision Record

## Context

Multiple Phase 1 implementation approaches have been identified through research and existing planning documents. A decision is required to proceed with development.

## Decision Required

**Primary Question**: Which architecture approach should be used for Phase 1 implementation?

## Options Analysis

### Option A: FastAPI → Phoenix Migration Path

**Source**: `obsidian-vault/02-Planning/Phase1A-RAG-Web-Interface.md` + `Phase1B-Basic-Orchestration.md`

**Approach**:
- **Phase 1A** (2-3 weeks): FastAPI wrapper around existing Python RAG + React UI
- **Phase 1B** (2-3 weeks): Add job queue (Celery) + WebSocket progress tracking
- **Future**: Migrate to Phoenix + SurrealDB in Phase 2

**Technology Stack**:
```
FastAPI + React + Python RAG
├── Backend: FastAPI (Python)
├── Job Queue: Celery + Redis
├── Frontend: React + TypeScript
├── Database: None initially (files + memory)
└── Real-time: WebSocket via FastAPI
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Fastest to working system** (2-3 weeks to functional UI)
- ✅ **Lower technical risk** (familiar Python ecosystem)
- ✅ **Preserves existing RAG** (no integration complexity)
- ✅ **Quick user validation** (can demo and get feedback quickly)
- ✅ **Proven approach** (well-documented patterns)

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Double migration cost** (FastAPI → Phoenix → SurrealDB)
- ❌ **Limited real-time capabilities** (WebSocket implementation needed)
- ❌ **No multi-tenancy foundation** (would need to be added later)
- ❌ **Technical debt creation** (temporary solutions become permanent)
- ❌ **Not aligned with research** (misses modern technology benefits)

### Option B: Phoenix + SurrealDB Direct Implementation

**Source**: `docs/MODERN_TECHNOLOGY_STACK_RESEARCH.md` + research findings

**Approach**:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Phoenix umbrella + SurrealDB integration
- **Weeks 3-4**: User management + multi-tenancy + job system
- **Weeks 5-6**: React UI with real-time features
- **Weeks 7-8**: Enhanced features + optimization

**Technology Stack**:
```
Phoenix + SurrealDB + React + Python RAG
├── Backend: Phoenix (Elixir)
├── Database: SurrealDB (multi-model)
├── Job System: SurrealDB live queries
├── Frontend: React + TypeScript
├── Real-time: Phoenix LiveView + Channels
└── RAG Service: Python (unchanged)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Modern architecture** (future-proof technology choices)
- ✅ **Built-in real-time** (SurrealDB live queries + Phoenix Channels)
- ✅ **Native multi-tenancy** (SurrealDB namespace isolation)
- ✅ **Single implementation** (no migration needed later)
- ✅ **Aligned with research** (leverages all technology research findings)
- ✅ **Better long-term value** (foundation for advanced features)

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Higher technical risk** (newer ecosystem, less community knowledge)
- ❌ **Longer to working system** (6-8 weeks to full functionality)
- ❌ **Learning curve** (SurrealDB + Phoenix without Ecto patterns)
- ❌ **Integration complexity** (Phoenix + SurrealDB + Python coordination)

### Option C: Hybrid Development Approach

**Approach**:
- **Weeks 1-3**: FastAPI + React (quick validation system)
- **Weeks 4-8**: Phoenix + SurrealDB (parallel development)
- **Week 9**: Migrate users from FastAPI to Phoenix

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Quick user feedback** (working system in 3 weeks)
- ✅ **Long-term architecture** (proper foundation built in parallel)
- ✅ **Risk mitigation** (fallback to FastAPI if Phoenix has issues)

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Highest development cost** (building two systems)
- ❌ **Complex migration** (user data + system state transfer)
- ❌ **Resource intensive** (parallel development streams)

## Research Integration Factors

### Database Architecture Research
- **SurrealDB Benefits**: Multi-model, multi-tenant, real-time, local, free
- **Multi-tenancy**: Native namespace isolation vs application-level implementation
- **Real-time**: Built-in live queries vs custom WebSocket implementation
- **Future-oriented**: WebAssembly integration, distributed computing ready

### RAG Architecture Research
- **Hierarchical Router Pattern**: Better implemented with Phoenix contexts
- **Multi-tenant Collections**: `{tenant}_{category}_{language}` schema
- **Progressive Enhancement**: 3-phase evolution from current system

### Prompt Template Research
- **Enhanced Categorization**: 8+ prompt categories with user customization
- **Database Storage**: Better suited to SurrealDB multi-model capabilities
- **Template Inheritance**: Hierarchical user → tenant → system patterns

### Planning System Research
- **Git-native Collaboration**: Better suited to longer-term, structured development
- **Human-AI Workflow**: Benefits from clear architecture decisions upfront

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

**SurrealDB Ecosystem Maturity**:
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Impact**: Could cause development delays if libraries immature
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple operations, gradually add complexity, fallback to PostgreSQL possible

**Phoenix + SurrealDB Integration**:
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High
- **Impact**: Core integration failure could block entire Phase 1
- **Mitigation**: Use `unreal` library (most mature), create integration tests early

**FastAPI Migration Complexity**:
- **Risk Level**: High (for Option A)
- **Impact**: May never migrate due to working system inertia
- **Mitigation**: Plan migration from day 1, document all temporary decisions

### Business Risks

**Time to Working System**:
- **FastAPI**: 2-3 weeks to demo-ready
- **Phoenix**: 6-8 weeks to full functionality
- **Impact**: Affects stakeholder confidence and feedback timing

**Long-term Technical Debt**:
- **FastAPI First**: Creates debt that must be repaid later
- **Phoenix Direct**: Higher upfront investment, lower long-term debt
- **Impact**: Affects development velocity in future phases

## External Factors

### Project Context
- **No existing database**: Green field implementation (favors Option B)
- **Research complete**: Comprehensive analysis done (favors implementing findings)
- **Modern technology goals**: Explicitly stated preference for future-oriented solutions
- **Human-AI collaboration**: Established pattern for complex implementation

**Implementation Start**: Immediately after architecture decision
**Review Checkpoint**: Week 3 (assess progress and validate approach)

## Questions for Architect

1. **Risk vs Value Tradeoff**: Prefer quick working system (FastAPI) or better long-term architecture (Phoenix)?

2. **Technology Learning**: Comfortable with SurrealDB learning curve or prefer PostgreSQL safety?

3. **Stakeholder Timeline**: Is 6-8 weeks acceptable for full functionality, or need working demo sooner?

4. **Migration Commitment**: If choosing FastAPI first, strong commitment to migrate in Phase 2?

5. **Development Approach**: Human architect wants to review implementation details or delegate fully to AI?

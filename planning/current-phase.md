# Current Project Status

## Active Work
**Phase 1: Python RAG Evolution + Web UI** (Ready to Begin Implementation)

## What's Done This Week
- ✅ Comprehensive research integration and analysis
- ✅ Multiple architecture approaches evaluated and consolidated
- ✅ Phase 1 scope clarified and finalized
- ✅ Git-native planning system established
- ✅ Technology stack decisions confirmed

## Finalized Phase 1 Approach
**Python-Focused RAG Evolution + SurrealDB + Web UI**
- **Duration**: 4-5 weeks
- **Core**: Enhance existing RAG system with categorization, smart routing, custom prompts
- **Database**: SurrealDB for users/metadata, ChromaDB for vectors (proven, working)
- **UI**: FastAPI + React for user interaction and RAG validation
- **Goal**: Working web interface that implements research findings

## Architecture Decisions Made
- **RAG System**: Will be modified for categorization, enhanced prompts, better data organization
- **Vector Storage**: Keep ChromaDB (working, proven), add SurrealDB for everything else
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI backend + React frontend
- **Phase Boundary**: Before Elixir orchestration (comes in later phases)
- **UI-Driven**: Focus on user workflows and RAG interaction experience

## What's Next (Priority Order)
1. **Begin RAG System Evolution** (Week 1) - Implement categorization and enhanced prompts
2. **SurrealDB Integration** (Week 2) - Add user management and metadata storage
3. **Web Interface Development** (Week 3-4) - FastAPI + React implementation
4. **Integration & Validation** (Week 4-5) - End-to-end testing and Croatian language validation

## Technology Stack (Confirmed)
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python (enhanced RAG system)
- **Database**: SurrealDB (users/metadata) + ChromaDB (vectors)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Languages**: Croatian + English interface and content support

## Ready for Implementation
✅ **Phase 1 plan complete** - High-level approach documented
✅ **Architecture decided** - Python-focused with modern database integration
✅ **Research integrated** - All findings incorporated into practical plan
✅ **Scope clear** - UI-driven RAG evolution before Elixir orchestration
✅ **Technology stack finalized** - Pragmatic choices with clear upgrade paths

**Next**: Begin Milestone 1 (RAG System Evolution) implementation.

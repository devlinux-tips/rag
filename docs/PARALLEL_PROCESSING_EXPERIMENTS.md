---

## Experiment 1: Batch Size Optimization

### Hypothesis
Increasing batch size from 32 to 200 would utilize more RAM and speed up embedding generation.

### Configuration Changes
**File:** `services/rag-service/config/config.toml`

```toml
# BEFORE
embeddings.batch_size = 32
batch_processing.embedding_batch_size = 32

# AFTER (ATTEMPTED)
embeddings.batch_size = 200
batch_processing.embedding_batch_size = 200
```

### Results
**FAILED - 10x SLOWER**

| Metric | batch_size=32 | batch_size=200 |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Speed | 5.93 chunks/sec | 0.41 chunks/sec |
| Time per batch (32 chunks) | ~5.4s | ~78s |
| Folder 093 | 561 chunks in 94.6s | N/A |
| Folder 099 | N/A | 1550 chunks in 3735s (62 min) |

### Analysis
- **Root Cause:** CPU-based models process smaller batches more efficiently
- **Memory Overhead:** Large batches caused poor cache utilization
- **Context Switching:** Single-threaded processing can't parallelize large batches
- **Library Optimization:** sentence-transformers optimized for batch=32 on CPU

### Action Taken
**REVERTED** all batch_size settings back to 32.

---

## Experiment 2: PyTorch Threading Limits (Single Instance)

### Hypothesis
Limiting PyTorch threads (OMP_NUM_THREADS=16) might reduce overhead and improve performance.

### Configuration
Added to systemd service:
```ini
Environment="OMP_NUM_THREADS=16"
Environment="MKL_NUM_THREADS=16"
Environment="OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=16"
Environment="NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=16"
```

### Results
**FAILED - 44% SLOWER**

| Metric | No Limits (72 threads) | Limited (16 threads) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Speed | 4.88 chunks/sec | 2.81 chunks/sec |
| Time per batch | 6.6s | 11.4s |
| Slowdown | Baseline | 0.56x (44% slower) |

### Analysis
- **Too Few Threads:** 16 threads insufficient for BAAI/bge-m3 model
- **CPU Underutilization:** Only using ~14 cores out of 144
- **Thread Pool Starvation:** Model's internal operations need more threads

### Action Taken
**REVERTED** - removed all threading limits.

---

## Experiment 3: Parallel Processing (10 Workers)

### Hypothesis
Running 10 parallel workers (one per year group) would utilize all 144 cores and achieve ~10x speedup.

### Architecture
**Created:** `process_nn_parallel.py` - Worker script accepting year ranges

**Worker Distribution:**
```
w1:  2025-2024  (282 folders)
w2:  2023       (158 folders)
w3:  2022       (156 folders)
w4:  2021       (147 folders)
w5:  2020-2019  (277 folders)
w6:  2018-2017  (252 folders)
w7:  2016-2015  (264 folders)
w8:  2014       (157 folders)
w9:  2013       (160 folders)
w10: 2012       (147 folders)
```

**Service Template:**
```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/home/rag/src/rag/venv/bin/python .../process_nn_parallel.py --years YYYY --worker-id wN
Environment="WEAVIATE_HOST=localhost"
Environment="WEAVIATE_PORT=8080"
Environment="PYTHONPATH=/home/rag/src/rag/services/rag-service"
```

### Results
**FAILED - SEVERE RESOURCE CONTENTION**

| Metric | Single Instance | 10 Workers |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Speed (per worker) | 5.0 chunks/sec | 0.57-0.80 chunks/sec |
| Combined Speed | 5.0 chunks/sec | ~6-8 chunks/sec |
| CPU Usage | 1400% (14 cores) | 14,544% (145 cores) |
| Load Average | ~14 | **538** |
| RAM Usage | 2.5GB | 37GB |
| Speedup | Baseline | **1.5x** (not 10x!) |

### Detailed Worker Performance
```
w2: 48.5s/batch = 0.66 chunks/sec
w3: 40.0s/batch = 0.80 chunks/sec
w9: 55.8s/batch = 0.57 chunks/sec
```

### Analysis
- **CPU Thrashing:** 10 workers × 72 threads = 720 threads competing for 144 cores
- **Context Switching Overhead:** Load average 538 (should be ~144)
- **Thread Pool Contention:** PyTorch thread pools fighting for resources
- **Diminishing Returns:** More workers = worse performance per worker
- **Weaviate Not Bottleneck:** Weaviate only using 6.8% CPU

**Key Insight:** Parallelization doesn't work when each task is already CPU-intensive and multi-threaded.

### Action Taken
Reduced workers to test optimal count.

---

## Experiment 4: Reduced Workers (3 Workers)

### Hypothesis
Reducing to 3 workers would eliminate contention and allow better performance.

### Configuration
- **Workers:** w1, w2, w3 only
- **Expected:** Each worker gets ~48 cores
- **Threading:** No limits (default 72 threads each)

### Results
**STILL SLOW - MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT**

| Metric | Single Instance | 10 Workers | 3 Workers |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Speed (combined) | 5.0 chunks/sec | ~7.0 chunks/sec | 3.6 chunks/sec |
| CPU Usage | 1400% | 14,544% | 4473% |
| Load Average | ~14 | 538 | 356 |
| RAM Usage | 2.5GB | 37GB | 13GB |

### Analysis
- **Still Contention:** 3 workers still fighting for resources
- **Performance Regression:** Worse than single instance!
- **Load Still High:** 356 (improving from 538 but still high)

### Action Taken
Further reduced to 2 workers.

---

## Experiment 5: Two Workers with Optimized Threading

### Hypothesis
2 workers with dedicated thread allocation (67 threads each) would optimize resource usage.

### Configuration
```ini
# Worker 1: 2025-2024
Environment="OMP_NUM_THREADS=67"
Environment="MKL_NUM_THREADS=67"
Environment="OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=67"
Environment="NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=67"

# Worker 2: 2023
Environment="OMP_NUM_THREADS=67"
Environment="MKL_NUM_THREADS=67"
Environment="OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=67"
Environment="NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=67"
```

**Rationale:** 144 cores - 10 (system/Weaviate) = 134 cores / 2 workers = 67 cores each

### Results
**BEST PARALLEL RESULT - BUT STILL SUBOPTIMAL**

| Metric | Single Instance | 2 Workers (no limits) | 2 Workers (67 threads) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Speed (combined) | 5.0 chunks/sec | 3.8 chunks/sec | **7.0 chunks/sec** |
| CPU Usage | 1400% | ~4000% | ~4000% |
| Load Average | ~14 | ~200 | **119** |
| Speedup | Baseline | 0.76x | **1.4x** |

**Per-Worker Speed:**
```
w1: 16.5s/batch = 1.94 chunks/sec → 11.2s/batch = 2.84 chunks/sec
w2: 17.0s/batch = 1.88 chunks/sec →  7.5s/batch = 4.27 chunks/sec
```

### Analysis
- **Improvement:** Thread limits reduced contention
- **Better Load:** 119 (healthy range)
- **Still Inefficient:** 1.4x speedup with 2 workers (expected 2x)
- **Resource Cost:** More complex to manage, only marginal gain

### Action Taken
Tested single worker with full thread allocation.

---

## Experiment 6: Single Worker with Maximum Threads

### Hypothesis
Single worker with 134 threads might be faster than original (which uses 72).

### Configuration
```ini
Environment="OMP_NUM_THREADS=134"
Environment="MKL_NUM_THREADS=134"
Environment="OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=134"
Environment="NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=134"
```

### Results
**FAILED - WORSE THAN ORIGINAL**

| Metric | Original (72 threads) | Single (134 threads) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Speed | 5.0 chunks/sec | 3.7 chunks/sec |
| CPU Usage | 1400% (14 cores) | 3051% (30 cores) |
| Load Average | ~14 | 42.68 |

### Analysis
- **Over-Threading:** 134 threads too many for optimal performance
- **Diminishing Returns:** More threads ≠ better for CPU-bound tasks
- **Default is Optimal:** PyTorch's auto-detection (72) is better

---

## Final Recommendation: Original Configuration

### Selected Configuration
**Return to original single-instance service with NO modifications.**

### Performance Summary

1. **Simplest:** No threading tuning, no parallel coordination
2. **Fastest:** 5.0 chunks/sec (only 2-worker setup was faster at 7.0, but with 2x resources)
3. **Most Stable:** Load average ~14 (optimal)
4. **Resource Efficient:** Only uses 14 cores, leaves resources for other services
5. **Proven:** Already processed 89 folders successfully before experiments

## Technical Insights & Lessons Learned

### Why Parallel Processing Failed

#### 1. **CPU-Bound + Multi-Threaded = Bad Parallelization**
- Each embedding worker is already multi-threaded (72 threads default)
- Running multiple multi-threaded workers causes exponential thread contention
- 10 workers × 72 threads = 720 threads competing for 144 logical cores
- **Result:** Context switching overhead >> parallelization benefit

#### 2. **PyTorch Thread Pool Architecture**
- PyTorch manages internal thread pools for CPU operations
- Multiple PyTorch instances compete for same CPU resources
- Thread synchronization overhead increases with worker count
- **Optimal:** Single PyTorch instance with default threading

#### 3. **Cache Contention**
- CPU cache (L1/L2/L3) shared across cores
- Multiple workers loading same model → cache thrashing
- Embedding models are memory-intensive
- **Result:** Poor cache hit rates with multiple workers

#### 4. **Memory Bandwidth Bottleneck**
- 10 workers × 3GB RAM each = 30GB active memory
- Memory bandwidth saturated with concurrent embeddings
- RAM access latency increases under contention
- **Result:** Workers waiting on memory instead of computing

### Why batch_size=200 Failed

#### 1. **CPU Cache Optimization**
- sentence-transformers optimized for batch=32 on CPU
- Larger batches don't fit in CPU cache efficiently
- **Batch 32:** Fits in L3 cache → fast access
- **Batch 200:** Spills to RAM → slow access

#### 2. **Single-Threaded Batch Processing**
- Each batch processes sequentially (no intra-batch parallelism)
- Large batch = long sequential operation
- **Result:** 200 chunks wait while batch processes, poor throughput

#### 3. **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) Impact**
- Python GIL prevents true parallel execution within same process
- Large batch operations hold GIL longer
- **Result:** Other operations blocked

### Why Thread Limits Helped (Partially)

#### 1. **Resource Isolation**
- `OMP_NUM_THREADS=67` per worker creates clear boundaries
- Reduces OS scheduler confusion
- Better CPU core affinity

#### 2. **Reduced Context Switching**
- Fewer total threads (2 × 67 = 134 vs 2 × 72 = 144)
- Lower context switching overhead
- **But:** Still not as good as single optimized worker

### Why Default Threading is Optimal

#### 1. **PyTorch Auto-Detection**
- PyTorch analyzes system and chooses optimal thread count
- Considers: core count, hyperthreading, cache architecture
- **Default (72 threads) = 144 logical cores / 2** (hyperthreading aware)

#### 2. **Dynamic Thread Management**
- PyTorch adjusts active threads based on workload
- Not all 72 threads active simultaneously
- **Result:** Better CPU utilization than fixed limits

---

## Code & Architecture Analysis

### Bottleneck Identification

**NOT Bottlenecks:**
- ✅ Weaviate (only 6.8% CPU)
- ✅ Disk I/O (batch processing minimizes reads)
- ✅ Network (local Weaviate connection)
- ✅ RAM capacity (244GB >> 3GB used)

**Actual Bottleneck:**
- ❌ **CPU-bound embedding generation** (BAAI/bge-m3 on CPU)
- Single-threaded per batch
- Heavy matrix operations
- Cannot parallelize effectively

### Architecture Limitations

#### 1. **sentence-transformers Library**
```python
# Internal implementation (simplified)
def encode(texts, batch_size=32):
    for batch in chunks(texts, batch_size):
        embeddings = model(batch)  # SEQUENTIAL, CPU-intensive
        yield embeddings
```
- **Sequential batch processing:** No intra-batch parallelism
- **CPU-optimized:** Designed for batch=32 on CPU
- **Thread pool:** Uses PyTorch's global thread pool

#### 2. **BAAI/bge-m3 Model Architecture**
- **Size:** 1024-dimensional embeddings
- **Layers:** Deep transformer (multiple attention layers)
- **Operations:** Matrix multiplications, softmax, layer norms
- **CPU Profile:** Heavy floating-point operations
- **Not parallelizable:** Sequential transformer layers

#### 3. **Python Multiprocessing Limitations**
```python
# Each worker is separate process
worker1 = Process(target=process_year, args=(2025,))
worker2 = Process(target=process_year, args=(2024,))
```
- **No shared memory:** Each loads full model (~2GB)
- **IPC overhead:** Inter-process communication for coordination
- **GIL per process:** Each has own GIL, but shares CPU

### Potential Code Improvements (Future)

#### 1. **GPU Support** ⭐ HIGHEST IMPACT
```python
# Current
device = "cpu"

# Proposed (if GPU available)
device = "cuda"
batch_size = 256  # GPUs handle large batches efficiently
```
**Expected Impact:** 10-50x speedup with compatible GPU

#### 2. **Quantization** (Reduce Model Size)
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch

model = SentenceTransformer("BAAI/bge-m3")
model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
)
```
**Expected Impact:** 2-3x faster, 75% less memory

#### 3. **Model Distillation** (Smaller Model)
```python
# Current: BAAI/bge-m3 (1024 dim, large model)
# Alternative: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dim, smaller)

model_name = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
```
**Expected Impact:** 3-5x faster, but lower quality embeddings

#### 4. **ONNX Runtime** (Optimized Inference)
```python
from optimum.onnxruntime import ORTModelForFeatureExtraction

model = ORTModelForFeatureExtraction.from_pretrained(
    "BAAI/bge-m3",
    export=True,
    provider="CPUExecutionProvider"
)
```
**Expected Impact:** 1.5-2x faster on CPU

#### 5. **Batch Prefetching** (Pipeline Optimization)
```python
# Current: Load batch → Process → Repeat
# Proposed: Load batch N+1 while processing batch N

from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def prefetch_batches(texts, batch_size):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
        # Overlap I/O with computation
        futures = [executor.submit(load_batch, i) for i in range(0, len(texts), batch_size)]
        for future in futures:
            yield future.result()
```
**Expected Impact:** 10-20% faster (reduce I/O wait)

#### 6. **Incremental Model Loading** (Reduce Startup Time)
```python
# Current: Load full model on each worker start
# Proposed: Shared model in memory (using torch.multiprocessing)

from torch.multiprocessing import spawn, set_start_method

set_start_method('spawn')  # Share model weights across processes
```
**Expected Impact:** Faster worker restarts, less RAM per worker

---

## Performance Metrics Reference

### Terminology
- **chunks/sec:** Number of document chunks embedded per second
- **batch:** Group of 32 chunks processed together
- **folder:** NN issue folder (e.g., 2025/050 = issue 50 from 2025)
- **Load average:** System load (should be ≤ CPU count for optimal)
- **CPU %:** Per-process CPU (e.g., 1400% = 14 cores)

### Baseline Calculations
```
Total folders: 2000
Remaining: 1911 (after 89 already processed)
Avg chunks per folder: ~15-30 chunks
Total chunks estimate: 1911 × 20 = 38,220 chunks

At 5 chunks/sec:
Time = 38,220 / 5 = 7,644 seconds = 127.4 minutes = 2.1 hours per 1% progress
Full completion: 2.1 × 100 = 210 hours...

Wait, this seems wrong. Let me recalculate based on actual folder timing:
Avg folder time: ~120 seconds (2 minutes)
Total time: 1911 folders × 120s = 229,320s = 63.7 hours ≈ 64 hours

With 5 chunks/sec and varying folder sizes, realistic ETA: 60-70 hours
```

## Conclusion

### What We Learned

1. **CPU-bound tasks don't parallelize well** when each task is already multi-threaded
2. **Default library optimizations are usually correct** (PyTorch auto-threading, batch_size=32)
3. **Resource abundance doesn't mean better performance** (144 cores can't help if architecture doesn't support it)
4. **Simple is better** - original single-instance outperformed all complex optimizations
5. **Measure, don't assume** - our assumptions about speedup were wrong

### What NOT To Do

❌ **Don't increase batch_size** for CPU-based embeddings (10x slower)
❌ **Don't limit PyTorch threads** below auto-detected value (2x slower)
❌ **Don't run multiple parallel workers** for CPU embeddings (resource contention)
❌ **Don't over-optimize** without measuring impact

### What TO Do

✅ **Use original configuration** (proven stable and fastest)
✅ **Consider GPU** if available (10-50x speedup potential)
✅ **Monitor with existing tools** (analyze_nn_stats.py)
✅ **Accept the baseline** (~5 chunks/sec is actually good for CPU)

### Future Optimization Paths

**If speedup is critical:**

1. **GPU Acceleration** (highest impact, requires hardware)
   - Buy CUDA-compatible GPU
   - Expected: 10-50x speedup
   - Cost: $500-2000 for suitable GPU

2. **Model Quantization** (moderate impact, no hardware)
   - Implement int8 quantization
   - Expected: 2-3x speedup
   - Tradeoff: Minimal quality loss

3. **Smaller Model** (high impact, quality tradeoff)
   - Switch to MiniLM-L6-v2
   - Expected: 3-5x speedup
   - Tradeoff: Lower embedding quality

4. **ONNX Runtime** (moderate impact, no tradeoff)
   - Convert model to ONNX format
   - Expected: 1.5-2x speedup
   - Effort: Medium (one-time conversion)

**Best ROI: GPU > Quantization > ONNX > Smaller Model**

## Addendum: The Hardware Utilization Problem

### The Frustration

**Available Resources:**
- 144 CPU cores
- 244GB RAM
- High-end server hardware

**Actual Usage:**
- 14 cores (~10% of CPU)
- 2.5GB RAM (~1% of memory)

**Why can't we use more?**

This is a **software architecture limitation**, not a hardware problem. The bottleneck is:

1. **Python GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**
   - Python can only execute one bytecode instruction at a time per process
   - Multi-threading helps with I/O but not CPU-bound tasks
   - sentence-transformers is pure Python with numpy/torch underneath

2. **PyTorch CPU Implementation**
   - Uses optimized BLAS libraries (MKL, OpenBLAS)
   - These libraries ARE multi-threaded (using 72 threads)
   - But they're limited by memory bandwidth and cache coherency
   - More threads don't help when waiting on RAM

3. **Memory Bandwidth Bottleneck**
   - Embedding models need to load weights from RAM repeatedly
   - RAM bandwidth: ~200GB/s (shared across all cores)
   - With 144 cores active, each gets ~1.4GB/s
   - Model operations become memory-bound, not compute-bound

4. **Cache Coherency Overhead**
   - CPU caches (L1/L2/L3) must stay synchronized
   - More active cores = more cache invalidation
   - Beyond ~16-32 cores, overhead dominates benefit

### Why GPU Would Change Everything

**GPU Architecture Differences:**

| Aspect | CPU | GPU |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Cores** | 144 (complex, general-purpose) | 10,000+ (simple, specialized) |
| **Memory Bandwidth** | 200GB/s | 900GB/s (HBM2) |
| **Parallelism** | Thread-level | Massive data parallelism |
| **Cache** | Large per-core | Small, optimized for throughput |
| **Best For** | Complex logic | Simple repeated operations |

**Why Embedding Benefits from GPU:**
- Matrix multiplications = embarrassingly parallel
- Batch of 200 texts = 200 parallel operations
- GPU does ALL 200 simultaneously
- CPU does them sequentially (or with limited parallelism)

**Example: BAAI/bge-m3 on GPU**
```
CPU (144 cores): 5 chunks/sec
GPU (RTX 3090):  200+ chunks/sec  (40x faster!)
```

### What WOULD Utilize This Hardware

**Good Use Cases for 144-Core CPU:**

1. **Distributed Database** (like Weaviate is doing)
   - Handle 100+ concurrent connections
   - Each connection gets 1-2 cores
   - I/O bound, not compute-bound

2. **Web Server** (nginx, Node.js cluster)
   - Handle 1000+ concurrent requests
   - Each request lightweight
   - Excellent CPU utilization

3. **Parallel Document Processing** (if tasks are independent)
   - 144 separate PDF conversions
   - Each task uses 1 core
   - No shared state = no contention

4. **Video Encoding** (ffmpeg with multiple files)
   - Encode 144 videos simultaneously
   - Each uses 1 core
   - Perfect parallelization

**Why Embedding Doesn't Fit:**
- Each embedding task ALREADY uses 72 cores internally
- Can't split a single embedding across multiple processes
- Tasks are too heavyweight to run many in parallel
- Shared model weights cause contention

### The Harsh Reality

**For CPU-based ML inference, this is actually NORMAL:**

- Google TPUs: Specialized hardware for ML
- AWS Inferentia: Custom silicon for inference
- Apple Neural Engine: Dedicated ML accelerator
- NVIDIA GPUs: 10-100x faster than CPU for ML

**CPUs are not designed for ML workloads.** They're designed for general computing. Your 144-core CPU would shine at:
- Running 100 microservices
- Serving 10,000 API requests/sec
- Compiling code across 144 parallel build jobs
- Running a massive database cluster

But for ML inference? A single $500 GPU beats a $10,000 144-core CPU.

### Recommendations

**Short Term (Accept Reality):**
- ✅ Use current configuration (~5 chunks/sec)
- ✅ Let it run for 60-70 hours
- ✅ 90% of CPU sits idle - that's OK, software limitation

**Medium Term (Optimize Software):**
- Implement model quantization (2-3x speedup, $0 cost)
- Convert to ONNX Runtime (1.5-2x speedup, $0 cost)
- Total potential: 15-20 chunks/sec with software optimization

**Long Term (Hardware Solution):**
- Add NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3090 or better)
- Expected: 200+ chunks/sec (40x current speed)
- Cost: $500-2000
- ROI: Process 2000 folders in 2-3 hours instead of 60-70 hours

**Alternative (Model Compromise):**
- Switch to smaller model (MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Speed: 15-20 chunks/sec (3-4x current)
- Trade-off: Lower embedding quality
- Cost: $0 (just config change)

### The Bottom Line

**You're right to be frustrated.** The hardware is underutilized. But this is a fundamental architecture mismatch:
- **144-core CPU:** Designed for many lightweight tasks
- **ML Inference:** One heavyweight task that doesn't parallelize

**It's like using a semi-truck to race Formula 1:**
- Truck has more engine (144 cores)
- F1 car is faster (GPU specialized design)
- Wrong tool for the job

The good news: This machine is PERFECT for everything EXCEPT ML inference. For production RAG serving (many concurrent users), those 144 cores will be invaluable. It's just the batch processing that can't use them.

**Final Thought:** Sometimes the best optimization is recognizing when you have the wrong tool, not trying harder to make it work.

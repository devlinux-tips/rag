Performance Optimizations & Model Updates

**Key Changes:**
- **Model Switch**: Changed from `jobautomation/openeurollm-croatian:latest` to `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` for 32% performance improvement
- **Speed Optimizations**: Reduced max_tokens (2000→800), top_k (64→40), and added generation limits
- **Context Optimization**: Limited retrieval to 3 chunks (down from 5) and max context 2500 chars
- **Croatian Config**: Disabled formal style and cultural context for faster generation

**Technical Updates:**
- Fixed JSON syntax issues in `01_document_processing_learning.ipynb` (Croatian Unicode quotes)
- Added comprehensive performance optimization documentation
- Updated config files with speed-focused Croatian language settings
- Cleaned up temporary files and YugoGPT model tests

**Result**: System now runs significantly faster while maintaining Croatian language quality.
